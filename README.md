Sticky Notes App
Introduction
This is a simple sticky notes application developed using React. It allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The project is a part of my learning journey in React and web development.

Features
Create Note: Users can add new notes with a title and content.
View Notes: All added notes are displayed on the screen.
Delete Note: Users can delete notes they no longer need.
Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
JavaScript: The programming language used to create the app's functionality.
HTML: The markup language used to structure the application.
CSS: The stylesheet language used to style the application.
Components
The application consists of the following components:

App: The main component that holds the state and renders other components.
Header: A simple header component.
Footer: A simple footer component.
Note: A component to display individual notes.
CreateArea: A component to create new notes.
Learning Outcomes
During the development of this project, I learned:

State Management in React: Using the useState hook to manage the state of notes.
Component Structure: Breaking down the application into reusable components.
Event Handling: Handling events such as adding and deleting notes.
JSX Syntax: Writing HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript.
Props: Passing data between components using props.
Array Methods: Using JavaScript array methods like map and filter to manage and display notes.
