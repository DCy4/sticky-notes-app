# Sticky Notes App

## Introduction

This is a simple sticky notes application developed using React. It allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The project is a part of my learning journey in React and web development.

## Features

- **Create Note**: Users can add new notes with a title and content.
- **View Notes**: All added notes are displayed on the screen.
- **Delete Note**: Users can delete notes they no longer need.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to create the app's functionality.
- **HTML**: The markup language used to structure the application.
- **CSS**: The stylesheet language used to style the application.

## Components

The application consists of the following components:

1. **App**: The main component that holds the state and renders other components.
2. **Header**: A simple header component.
3. **Footer**: A simple footer component.
4. **Note**: A component to display individual notes.
5. **CreateArea**: A component to create new notes.

## Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I learned:

- **State Management in React**: Using the `useState` hook to manage the state of notes.
- **Component Structure**: Breaking down the application into reusable components.
- **Event Handling**: Handling events such as adding and deleting notes.
- **JSX Syntax**: Writing HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript.
- **Props**: Passing data between components using props.
- **Array Methods**: Using JavaScript array methods like `map` and `filter` to manage and display notes.
